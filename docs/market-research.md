**Threat level to SBM:** LOW. Different audience (beginners/social creators vs DJs/producers). No overlap on our core features (stem separation, AI generation, DJ tools).

---

### 1.2 Splice

**What they offer:** Sample/loop marketplace with credits system. Virtual instruments (Splice Instrument plugin). Astra synthesizer. Beatmaker drum sequencer. Skills tutorials (150+). DAW integrations (Pro Tools, Studio One, Ableton). Rent-to-own plugins.

**Pricing:**
- Sounds+: $12.99/month (sample credits)
- Creator: $19.99/month (samples + Instrument + Astra + Beatmaker)
- Creator+: $39.99/month (everything + more credits + premium packs)

**User base:** 4M+ creators. Dominant sample marketplace.

**Strengths:**
- Best sample library in the industry (millions of samples)
- Credits system lets you keep downloads forever
- Rent-to-own plugin model is brilliant
- Deep DAW integrations
- Used by top-tier producers

**Weaknesses:**
- No AI generation
- No mastering
- No stem separation
- No DJ tools
- Pure marketplace/content play, not a production tool
- No music discovery or event features

**Threat level to SBM:** LOW. Splice is a content library. SBM is a production/DJ toolkit. Complementary, not competitive.

---

### 1.3 LANDR

**What they offer:** AI mastering (their flagship). Music distribution (100% royalties while subscribed, 85/15 split after cancel). Samples library. Plugin bundles. Collaboration tools. Online courses.

**Pricing:**
- Essentials: $12.99/month (unlimited MP3 masters, distribution, 100 sample credits, $500 plugin bundle)
- Pro: $24.99/month (MP3 + WAV + HD WAV masters, Pro mastering plugin, 200 sample credits, $2,000 plugin bundle)
- Annual plans: Basic $23.99/yr, Pro $49.99/yr, Studio Essentials $99.99/yr

**User base:** Estimated 3-5M users.

**Strengths:**
- AI mastering is mature and well-known (trained on human mastering engineers)
- Unlimited revisions on paid plans
- Distribution + mastering bundle is strong value
- Plugin bundles add perceived value
- Established brand in the space

**Weaknesses:**
- Mastering quality is "good enough" but not studio-grade (pros still use human mastering)
- No stem separation
- No AI music generation
- No DJ-specific tools
- No music discovery features
- Distribution locks you in (85/15 split if you cancel)

**Threat level to SBM:** MEDIUM on mastering only. LANDR is the benchmark for AI mastering. Our mastering (Pedalboard-based) needs to match or exceed their quality. But LANDR doesn't touch 8 of our 10 modes.

---

### 1.4 iZotope Ozone

**What they offer:** Professional mastering plugin suite. 20 modules in Advanced edition. AI Master Assistant. Stem EQ (isolate and EQ individual instruments in a stereo mix). Bass Control (AI-powered low end shaping). Unlimiter (ML-powered dynamics restoration).

**Pricing:**
- Elements: $55 (one-time) — basic Master Assistant
- Standard: $219 (one-time) — 14 modules
- Advanced: $499 (one-time) — 20 modules, individual DAW plugins
- Subscription: ~$19.99/month (access to Ozone + other iZotope tools)

**User base:** Industry standard. Used in professional studios worldwide.

**Strengths:**
- Gold standard for mastering plugins
- Stem EQ is genuinely innovative
- One-time purchase option (no subscription lock-in)
- Deep, granular control for professionals
- Works as DAW plugin (integrates into existing workflow)

**Weaknesses:**
- Desktop plugin only (no web access)
- Steep learning curve
- Expensive for hobbyists
- Mastering only; no other production tools
- No AI generation, no stem separation, no DJ tools
- No discovery, no events, no social features

**Threat level to SBM:** LOW-MEDIUM. Different market (professional mastering engineers vs our broader audience). Our mastering is simpler but integrated into a larger suite. Nobody choosing between SBM and Ozone; they serve different needs.

---

### 1.5 Amper Music (Shutterstock)

**What they offer:** Enterprise AI music generation for royalty-free soundtracks. Integrated into Shutterstock's content platform. Generates custom music for video, podcasts, media.

**Pricing:**
- Pay-per-download: from $5/track
- Pro: $14.99/month
- Enterprise: custom pricing
- Also included in Shutterstock subscriptions

**User base:** Enterprise/media production focused. Not consumer-facing.

**Strengths:**
- Full commercial licensing included
- Enterprise-grade reliability
- Integrated into Shutterstock ecosystem (massive distribution)
- Copyright-safe output

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a creative tool; it's a stock music generator
- No customization beyond basic parameters
- Not for musicians; it's for content creators who need background music
- Acquired and absorbed into Shutterstock (less innovation)
- No stem separation, mastering, DJ tools, discovery

**Threat level to SBM:** NONE. Completely different market (stock music for media vs music production for DJs/producers).

---

### 1.6 Suno AI

**What they offer:** Full AI music generation from text prompts. Creates complete songs (vocals, instruments, arrangement, lyrics). Suno Studio (AI-native DAW with timeline editing, MIDI export). v4.5+ model with high-quality output.

**Pricing:**
- Free: 50 credits/day (~10 songs/day), non-commercial
- Pro: $10/month ($8/month annual) — 2,500 credits/month (~500 songs), commercial rights
- Premier: $30/month ($24/month annual) — 10,000 credits/month, stem splitting, personas, advanced editing

**User base:** 10M+ users (largest pure AI music generation platform).

**Strengths:**
- Best-in-class AI music generation quality
- Full song generation (vocals + instruments + lyrics)
- Suno Studio is becoming a real DAW
- Massive user base and community
- Warner Music deal adds legitimacy
- Generous free tier drives adoption

**Weaknesses:**
- Output quality still "obviously AI" to trained ears
- Commercial rights require paid plan
- No stem separation of existing tracks
- No mastering tools
- No DJ tools
- No music discovery or events
- Copyright concerns (lawsuit with major labels, now settling)
- Downloads temporarily limited during licensing transitions

**Threat level to SBM:** MEDIUM on AI generation only. Suno's generation quality is ahead of MusicGen (which SBM uses). But Suno is generation-only. SBM offers generation as one feature in a 10-mode suite. Different value prop.

---

### 1.7 Udio

**What they offer:** AI music generation with deep customization. Custom lyrics, model behavior control, lyric timing/clarity settings. Text-to-music with genre control.

**Pricing:**
- Free: 100 monthly credits + 10 daily credits
- Standard: $10/month — 2,400 credits
- Pro: $30/month — 6,000 credits

**User base:** Estimated 2-5M users.

**Strengths:**
- More granular control than Suno
- Deep lyric integration
- Commercial use rights on output
- Universal Music partnership (legitimacy)

**Weaknesses:**
- Downloads temporarily disabled during 2025-2026 licensing transition (major issue)
- Smaller community than Suno
- Generation-only tool
- No mastering, stem separation, DJ tools, discovery
- Copyright concerns still being resolved

**Threat level to SBM:** LOW. Same reasoning as Suno but weaker position. Generation-only, and currently hamstrung by download restrictions.

---

### 1.8 Boomy

**What they offer:** Simplest AI music creation platform. Genre/mood selection generates tracks. Distribution to Spotify, Apple Music, etc. Monetization through streaming royalties.

**Pricing:**
- Free: Unlimited creation, 5 song saves, 1 release
- Creator: $9.99/month — 500 saves, 3 releases
- Pro: $29.99/month — unlimited saves, 10 releases, analytics, monetization

**User base:** 20M+ songs created. Lower active user engagement than Suno/Udio.

**Strengths:**
- Easiest entry point (zero music knowledge required)
- Built-in distribution and monetization
- Good for passive income experiments

**Weaknesses:**
- Output quality is the lowest of the AI generators
- Very limited customization
- "Quantity over quality" model
- Not taken seriously by musicians
- No mastering, stem separation, DJ tools

**Threat level to SBM:** NONE. Boomy targets people who have never made music. SBM targets DJs and producers who already know what they want.

---

### 1.9 Moises.ai

**What they offer:** AI-powered stem separation (their core). 7-stem separation (vocals, keys, drums, guitar, bass, strings, other). Voice Studio with AI voice models. Chord detection (easy/medium/advanced). Practice tools for musicians. VST plugin (Stems Plugin).

**Pricing:**
- Free: Limited separations
- Premium: $3.99/month — all stems, premium quality
- Pro: $24.99/month — HiFi quality, dialogue/music/SFX separation

**User base:** 40M+ downloads across platforms.

**Strengths:**
- Best-in-class stem separation quality (7 stems)
- Dedicated mobile app (huge for practice musicians)
- VST plugin integrates into DAWs
- Chord detection is accurate and useful
- Very affordable Premium tier
- 40M+ downloads shows real demand for stem separation

**Weaknesses:**
- Stem separation only (plus basic practice tools)
- No mastering
- No AI generation
- No DJ-specific tools (set building, events, discovery)
- No community or social features

**Threat level to SBM:** HIGH on stem separation specifically. Moises is the category leader for stem separation. Our Demucs-based separation needs to be comparable quality. But again, Moises is a single-feature tool; SBM is a suite.

---

### 1.10 DJ.Studio

**What they offer:** DJ set building software. Timeline-based editor. AI automix (optimizes track ordering by BPM and harmonic key via Camelot Wheel). Imports from rekordbox, Serato, VirtualDJ, Mixed In Key, Engine DJ, Traktor. Video export with reactive animations. Ableton Live export.

**Pricing:**
- Studio: $99 (perpetual license)
- Pro: $149 (perpetual)
- Pro + Stems: $199 (perpetual)
- Ultimate: ~$249 (perpetual)
- Update Package: $49/year after first year

**User base:** Newer product, growing. Niche but well-reviewed.

**Strengths:**
- Purpose-built for DJ set creation (the only dedicated tool)
- Harmonic mixing intelligence (Camelot Wheel analysis)
- Imports from all major DJ platforms
- One-time purchase (no subscription fatigue)
- Video export is a differentiator

**Weaknesses:**
- Desktop only
- No AI generation
- No mastering
- Stem separation only in higher tiers
- No music discovery or events
- No chat/AI assistant
- Niche audience

**Threat level to SBM:** MEDIUM on set building specifically. DJ.Studio is more mature for set building. But SBM's Set Builder is one mode in a suite, and we add AI intelligence (Azure OpenAI) that DJ.Studio lacks. Plus SBM is web-based.

---

### 1.11 Other Notable Competitors

| Competitor | Focus | Threat to SBM |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Soundful** | AI music generation for creators | LOW (stock music, not creative) |
| **AIVA** | AI composition (classical/film scoring) | NONE (different genre) |
| **Soundraw** | AI music for video/content | NONE (stock music) |
| **Serato Studio** | Beat making for DJs | LOW (desktop DAW, no AI) |
| **rekordbox** | DJ performance software | LOW (live DJ, not production) |
| **Mixed In Key** | Key/BPM analysis | LOW (single feature we already have) |

### Where SBM Wins

1. **Only all-in-one suite.** No competitor combines AI chat + discovery + mastering + stems + generation + events + set building + mix digestor in one platform. Every competitor is 1-2 features. SBM is 10.

2. **DJ Command (AI Chat).** Nobody else has a conversational AI music assistant. This is unique.

3. **Mix Digestor.** Nobody else has automated mix tracklist extraction. Unique feature for the DJ market.

4. **Events Radar.** Nobody else integrates event discovery into a production tool.

5. **Spotify-native workflow.** Pull playlists, analyze BPM/key/energy, build sets from your actual library.

6. **Web-based with no install.** vs Ozone (desktop plugin), DJ.Studio (desktop app), Splice (desktop app for samples).

### Where SBM Is Behind

1. **Stem separation quality.** Moises is the leader with 7-stem HiFi. Our Demucs via Replicate is solid but not best-in-class.

2. **AI generation quality.** Suno v4.5 produces full songs with vocals. Our MusicGen produces instrumental clips. Significant gap.

3. **Mastering depth.** LANDR and Ozone offer more control and higher quality. Our Pedalboard mastering is basic.

4. **No mobile app.** BandLab, Moises, Suno, Splice all have mobile apps. SBM is web-only.

5. **No distribution.** BandLab, LANDR, and Boomy include music distribution. We don't.

6. **No DAW plugin.** Ozone and Moises offer VST plugins. We're browser-only.

7. **No social/community features.** BandLab's community is a massive retention driver.

## 3. GAP ANALYSIS & V2 PRIORITIES

### Critical Gaps (V2 Must-Haves)

| Priority | Gap | Why | Effort |
|----------|-----|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Upgrade AI generation** | MusicGen is behind Suno/Udio. Consider integrating Suno API or Stable Audio Open as alternatives. Or position generation as "experimental/instrumental" and lean into what we do better. | HIGH |
| 2 | **Improve stem separation** | Moises sets the bar. Upgrade to latest Demucs model (htdemucs_ft) or explore hybrid approaches. Add 6-stem support (vocals, drums, bass, guitar, keys, other). | MEDIUM |
| 3 | **Mastering presets & A/B** | LANDR lets users compare before/after and choose styles. We need genre-specific mastering presets and instant A/B comparison. | MEDIUM |
| 4 | **Mobile responsiveness** | Not a native app, but the Streamlit UI should work on mobile. Currently it doesn't. | MEDIUM |

### Strong Differentiators to Double Down On

| Feature | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| **DJ Command** | This is our moat. No competitor has a conversational AI music assistant. Add more context awareness (know user's library, preferences, recent activity). Make it the central hub. |
| **Mix Digestor** | Unique. Build it out with automatic BPM/key analysis per track, transition analysis, energy flow visualization. Make it the best mix analysis tool that exists. |
| **Set Builder + Spotify** | Combine Spotify library analysis with AI-powered set ordering (Camelot wheel + energy flow). DJ.Studio does this desktop-only. We do it web-based with AI. |
| **Events Radar** | Nobody else connects events to production. "Event on Friday? Here's the venue, here's the crowd profile, here's a set suggestion based on the genre." |

### V2 Feature Roadmap

| Phase | Features | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| V2.0 | Mastering A/B comparison, genre presets, improved stem separation (htdemucs_ft) | 2-3 weeks |
| V2.1 | DJ Command memory (remembers preferences), Set Builder auto-ordering by key/energy | 2 weeks |
| V2.2 | Mix Digestor enhancements (BPM/key per track, energy flow chart, transition analysis) | 2 weeks |
| V2.3 | Mobile responsive layout, PWA wrapper | 2-3 weeks |
| V3.0 | Distribution integration (DistroKid API or similar), social features (share sets/mixes) | 4-6 weeks |

### Unique Angle / Positioning

**"The DJ's AI Brain."**

Every competitor does one thing. Suno generates music. Moises splits stems. LANDR masters tracks. DJ.Studio builds sets. SBM is the only platform that connects all of these into a single workflow with an AI assistant that understands music production context.

The pitch is NOT "we're better at mastering than LANDR" or "we generate better music than Suno." The pitch is: **"One platform, one login, every tool a DJ or producer needs, connected by AI that knows your style."**

This is the Figma play for music production: not the best at any single thing, but the best integrated experience.

## 4. PRICING ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Competitor Pricing Summary

| Competitor | Free | Entry Paid | Mid | High |
|-----------|------|------------|-----|------|
| BandLab | Full DAW free | $8.25/mo (annual) | $14.95/mo (monthly) | - |
| Splice | Limited | $12.99/mo | $19.99/mo | $39.99/mo |
| LANDR | - | $12.99/mo | $24.99/mo | $99.99/yr |
| Suno | 50 credits/day | $10/mo | $30/mo | - |
| Udio | 100 credits/mo | $10/mo | $30/mo | - |
| Boomy | 5 saves | $9.99/mo | $29.99/mo | - |
| Moises | Limited | $3.99/mo | $24.99/mo | - |
| DJ.Studio | - | $99 one-time | $149 one-time | $199-249 one-time |
| Ozone | - | $55 one-time | $219 one-time | $499 one-time |

**Market median for monthly SaaS music tools: $10-25/month for the primary paid tier.**

### 4.2 API Cost Estimation (Per User Per Month)

Assumptions: Active user = 20 sessions/month. Not every session hits every API.

| API | Cost Per Call | Est. Calls/User/Month | Monthly Cost/User |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)** | ~$0.01-0.03 per conversation turn (input + output) | 60 turns (DJ Command, discovery, set suggestions) | $0.60 - $1.80 |
| **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)** | ~$0.001-0.003 per turn | 60 turns (if using mini for lighter tasks) | $0.06 - $0.18 |
| **Replicate MusicGen** | $0.064 per generation | 10 generations | $0.64 |
| **Replicate Demucs** | $0.018 per separation | 8 separations | $0.14 |
| **Spotify API** | Free (but Premium required for dev access) | Unlimited (rate-limited) | $0.00 (dev subscription: $10.99/mo flat) |
| **AudD (Mix Digestor)** | ~$0.01-0.05 per track identification | 20 identifications (2-3 mixes digested) | $0.20 - $1.00 |

**Estimated COGS per active user per month:**
- Light user: $0.50 - $1.00
- Medium user: $1.50 - $3.00
- Heavy user (power DJ): $3.00 - $6.00
- Spotify dev subscription: $10.99/mo flat (amortized across users)

**Key insight:** At the current pricing concept, even the Free tier needs guardrails or it bleeds money. Every AI call costs real money.

### 4.3 Current Pricing Concept Review

| Tier | Price | Assessment |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Free** | $0 | DANGEROUS without limits. Need strict caps: 5 AI chats/day, 2 generations/month, 1 stem separation/month, no Mix Digestor. Otherwise free users cost $1-3/month each. |
| **Creator $14.99/mo** | $14.99 | COMPETITIVE. Right in the market median ($10-25). At estimated COGS of $2-3/mo for medium users, margin is 80%. Good. |
| **Pro $34.99/mo** | $34.99 | SLIGHTLY HIGH vs competitors (Suno Premier $30, Moises Pro $25, LANDR Pro $25). Consider $29.99. Or justify with unique features (unlimited Mix Digestor, priority generation). |
| **Studio $99.99/mo** | $99.99 | TOO HIGH for current feature set. LANDR's entire annual plan is $99.99. Ozone Advanced is $499 one-time. This tier only works if it includes exclusive features like API access, white-label, or team features. Consider $49.99 or reposition as annual plan pricing. |

### 4.4 Recommended Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Includes | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5 DJ Command chats/day, 3 AI generations/month, 2 stem separations/month, Discovery (limited), Events Radar, Dashboard. NO Mix Digestor, NO Set Builder export. | Hook users with DJ Command and Discovery. Cap expensive API calls hard. |
| **Creator** | $14.99/mo ($11.99/mo annual) | 50 DJ Command chats/day, 20 generations/month, 10 separations/month, 5 mix digestions/month, Set Builder (save/export), Producer Tools, all modes unlocked. | Sweet spot for hobbyist DJs. Matches LANDR Essentials and Splice entry. Margin ~75-80%. |
| **Pro** | $29.99/mo ($24.99/mo annual) | Unlimited DJ Command, 50 generations/month, 30 separations/month, unlimited Mix Digestor, priority processing, advanced mastering presets, Set Builder with AI optimization. | Matches Suno Premier ($30) and Udio Pro ($30). Target: working DJs and producers. Margin ~70-75%. |
| **Studio** | $49.99/mo ($39.99/mo annual) | Everything unlimited, API access for integrations, team collaboration (share sets/mixes), custom mastering profiles, early access to new features, white-label export. | Dropped from $99.99. This is for semi-pro and small studios. Competes with Splice Creator+ ($40). |

**Annual discount:** ~20% off (industry standard).

**Why drop Studio from $99.99 to $49.99:** The $99.99 tier has no market support at our current feature depth. LANDR Pro is $25. Suno Premier is $30. Splice Creator+ is $40. Ozone Advanced is a one-time $499 for industry-standard mastering. Nobody is paying $100/month for an AI music suite that isn't a full DAW. At $49.99 with team features and API access, it's defensible.

### 4.5 Revenue Model at Scale

| Scenario | Users | Free | Creator | Pro | Studio | MRR | ARR |
|----------|-------|------|---------|-----|--------|-----|-----|
| Launch (Month 3) | 500 | 400 | 60 | 30 | 10 | $2,389 | $28,668 |
| Growth (Month 12) | 5,000 | 3,500 | 900 | 450 | 150 | $27,886 | $334,632 |
| Scale (Month 24) | 25,000 | 17,500 | 4,500 | 2,250 | 750 | $139,432 | $1,673,184 |

Assumes 80% free, 12% Creator, 6% Pro, 2% Studio conversion rates (industry average for freemium SaaS with a strong free tier is 2-5% total conversion; we're being optimistic at 20% because the free tier is intentionally limited).

## 6. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
1. **Lock the free tier limits.** Every uncapped free user costs $1-3/month. Set hard caps before launch.
2. **Improve mastering A/B.** This is the easiest "wow moment" to build. Before/after comparison sells itself.
3. **DJ Command is the moat.** Every marketing asset should lead with DJ Command. It's the only thing nobody else has.

### Short-term (60-90 Days)
4. **Product Hunt launch.** This is the single highest-ROI launch channel for a tool like this.
5. **YouTube content.** Record screen captures of actual workflows. "Watch me build a DJ set in 2 minutes with AI."
6. **Partner with 3-5 small DJ YouTubers.** Gift Pro accounts, ask for honest reviews.

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
7. **Upgrade AI generation.** MusicGen is falling behind Suno/Udio. Evaluate Stable Audio Open or building a Suno integration.
8. **Mobile responsive.** Non-negotiable for the under-30 audience.
9. **Community features.** Share sets, share mixes, follow other DJs. This is how BandLab hit 100M users.

### Do NOT Do (Common Traps)
- Do NOT try to be a full DAW. That's BandLab's game and they have 100M users.
- Do NOT compete on AI generation quality alone. Suno has $125M+ in funding. Focus on the integrated experience.
- Do NOT add distribution in V2. It's a commodity feature and it's operationally complex (label agreements, royalty tracking). Revisit in V3+.
- Do NOT build a native mobile app yet. Progressive Web App first, native later if demand proves out.
